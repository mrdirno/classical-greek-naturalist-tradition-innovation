### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Philo uses his father's empirical method to solve a social or political problem in the city, infuriating the traditional philosophers.
- Create a dialogue between Leonidas and a priest of Asclepius about the nature of disease: is it an imbalance of humors or a tangible entity to be catalogued?
- Draft a 'field note' entry from Philo's journal describing a common animal (e.g., a dog) purely through measurable, observable data, stripping all metaphor and cultural association.
- Imagine a confrontation where a character inspired by Philo's methods attempts to apply them to something Leonidas considered sacrosanct—like the memory of Philo's mother.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'Naturalist's Codex' system: a structured, non-linear database for cataloguing observations (soil samples, weather, flora/fauna) that allows for linking cause and effect, inspired by Leonidas's ledger worldview.
- Build a 'Socratic Debugger': a dialogue-based tool that helps identify flaws in an argument or process by asking iterative, probing questions, mirroring the philosophical challenges Philo faces.
